# T2TRG / W3C WoT meeting in Singapore

We will have a joint T2TRG / W3C Web of Things (WoT) workshop on Friday, November 15th, in Singapore before the IETF week. We are planning to focus in the workshop on a few broad areas:

* Self-Description, Semantics, and Internet standards; research with W3C Web of Things 
* One Data Model and semantic tools for Thing interoperability 
* Establishing the desirability of and enabling Thing-to-Thing connectivity

We plan to start the workshop with a couple of keynotes and then dive into technical topics driven by short presentations and related discussions. We hope to engage also with the local research community and invite in particular IoT researchers and practitioners from Singapore to join the workshop.

If you have a proposal for a presentation / technical topic, please send email to us now (t2trg-chairs@irtf.org), so we can make sure we have space on the agenda.

## Logistics

Location: [Kent Ridge Guild House](https://www.nuss.org.sg/kent-ridge/27), National University of Singapore (NUS) \[yes, they do have a [dress code][]\]

[dress code]: https://www.nuss.org.sg/news/nuss-dress-code-updated

Time: 9:00 - 17:00, November 15th, 2019

Details for transport from IETF hotels:
* By cab (e.g., local Uber equivalent "[Grab]"):
    - If three or four people share it won't be that much more than taking transit.
    - Allow 30–45 minutes (traffic may be heavy in the morning).
* Public transit:
    - Get on the MRT Circle line (for a cicuitous route, at the Esplanade station near the Swissotel, or preferably, from City Hall station under the Swissotel using the East-West line and changing at Buona Vista station) and get off at Kent Ridge Station.
    - Take the free NUS shuttle bus leaving from nearby Bus Stop 3.   
    - Take the A1 to get to the Guild House and the A2 to return.
    - Allow 1h.
    - It is not recommended to walk from the MRT to the Guild house.  The map is misleading, the terrain is hilly and the MRT is surrounded by a large hospital without good walking connection to NUS.  The area is unfortunately designed for cars.
